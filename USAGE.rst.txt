From the Command Line 
---------------------
VICE allows simple simulations to be ran directly from the command line. 
For instructions on how to use this functionality, run ``vice --help`` in a 
terminal from any directory (with the exception of VICE's source directory). 

If this feature does not work after installing VICE, troubleshooting can be 
found `here`__. 

**Note**: VICE's functionality is severely limited when ran from the command 
line in comparison to its full Python_ capabilities.
