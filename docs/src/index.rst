VICE: Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution
=================================================
Welcome!
This is the documentation for **VICE version 1.3.0.dev0**.
First time users should familiarize themselves with VICE's API by going
through our `tutorial`__, available on `GitHub`__ along with the source code
and other supplementary material.
Usage instructions for all of the functions and objects that VICE provides can
be found in our :ref:`comprehensive API reference <apiref>`.
Details on VICE's implementation and justification thereof can be found in
our :ref:`science documentation <scidocs>`.

VICE's developers are happy to consult with scientists looking to
incorporate it into their research.
Email one of our :ref:`contributors <contributors>` or `join us on Slack`__
