Nucleosynthetic Yields 
======================
Due to the associated uncertainties [1]_, VICE takes an agnostic approach to 
the user's desired nucleosynthetic yields. Rather than adopting the results of 
a nucleosynthesis study, the user declares their yields outright. VICE 
includes features which will calculate yields upon request, but requires the 
user to explicitly tell it what the yield of each element from each enrichment 
channel should be [2]_. 


.. [1] See Andrews, Weinberg, Schoenrich & Johnson (2017), ApJ, 835, 224 and 
	the citations therein for a detailed analysis of multiple elements. 

.. [2] There is, however, a set of defaults for each.
