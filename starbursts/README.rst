Johnson & Weinberg (2019) Starbursts Paper Code 
===============================================

We provide here the ``python`` code which produces the figures in the 
`Johnson & Weinberg (2019)`__ paper on the effect of starburst models on 
predicted element abundances. Simply running ``make`` in this directory will 
run the simulations and produce all of the figures as they appear in that 
paper. Alternatively, users can run ``make starburst`` from the root directory 
of ``VICE``'s source tree. The figures will be located here once the code is 
finished. 

Users are also welcome to use the code provided here as examples of how to 
use ``VICE`` if they so choose.
