VICE global variables 
===================== 
This module contains variables that are global to the VICE package. 

Contents 
======== 
_DEFAULT_FUNC_ :: <function> 
	The default func attribute of the singlezone class. It takes in one 
	parameter and returns the value of 9.1 always. 
_DEFAULT_BINS_ :: list 
	The default bins attribute of the singlezone class. It is all values 
	between -3 and +1 (inclusive) in steps of 0.05. 
_RECOGNIZED_ELEMENTS_ :: tuple 
	The elements for which VICE is capable of simulating the enrichment and 
	calculating nucleosynthetic yields. This includes all astrophysically 
	produced elements between carbon and bismuth. 
_RECOGNIZED_IMFS_ :: tuple 
	The stellar initial mass functions built into VICE. Currently this 
	includes only the Kroupa (1) and Salpeter (2) IMFs.
