 * Fields:
 * =======
 * imf:				The IMF to assume 
 *						VICE currently recognizes only Kroupa and Salpeter 
 * dtd:				The SNe Ia delay-time distribution to adopt 
 * mdf:				The stellar metallicity distribution function for each 
 * 						element 
 * bins:			The bins in which to sort the stellar MDF 
 * num_bins:		The number of bins in the array bins
 *						This is equal to the length of the bins array + 1 
 * eta:				The mass loading parameter at each timestep 
 * enh:				The outflow enhancement factor at each timestep 
 * Zin:				The inflow metallicity of each element at each timestep 
 * R: 				The cumulative return fraction at all timesteps 
 * H:				The hydrogen burning mass fraction at all timesteps 
 * tau_star:		The depletion time at all timesteps 
 * schmidt_index: 	The power law index on Kennicutt-Schmidt star formation 
 * 						efficiency 
 * mgschmidt: 		The normalization of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law 
 * t_d:				The minimum delay time for SNe Ia from a single stellar 
 * 						population 
 * tau_ia:			The e-folding timescale of SNe Ia 
 *  					Only relevant when the user is adopting the built-in 
 * 						exponential DTD 
 * ria: 			The SNe Ia DTD iself, normalized, and evaluated at all 
 * 						timesteps 
 * smoothing_time:	The outflow smoothing timescale in Gyr 
 * m_upper: 		The upper mass limit on star formation in Msun
 * m_lower:			The lower mass limit on star formation in Msun 
 * R0:				The recycling parameter, if continuous recycling is not 
 * 						implemented 
 * continuous: 		Whether or not to implement continuous recycling 
 * 						(1 for yes; 0 for no) 
 * schmidt: 		Whether or not to implement the Kennicutt-Schmidt law 
 * 						(1 for yes; 0 for no)
 * Z_solar:			The metallicity of the sun to adopt 
 * 						Default and recommended: 0.014 (Asplund et al. 2009)
