=================================================================== 
Importing this module will automatically set all yield settings 
from core collapse supernovae to the IMF-integrated yields as 
determined from the simulations ran by Chieffi & Limongi (2004) at 
Z = 0.02 ([M/H] = 0.15 if the solar abundance is Z = 0.014; Asplund 
et al. 2009). In doing so, it will default to an upper mass limit on star 
formation of 35 Msun. This is done to minimize numerical artifacts; this is 
the highest mass on the Chieffi & Limongi (2004) grid. 

VICE achieves this by calling yields.ccsne.fractional for every 
element built into the software and storing the returned value in 
yields.ccsne.settings.  

set_params :: Update the parameters with which the yields are calculated 

Notes 
===== 
By importing this module, the user does not sacrifice the flexibility of 
VICE's user specified yields. The fields of vice.yields.ccsne.settings can 
still be modified in whatever manner the user sees fit. 

This module is not imported with the simple 'import vice' statement. 

Example 
======= 
>>> from vice.yields.ccsne import CL04 
>>> CL04.set_params(lower = 0.3, upper = 40, IMF = "salpeter")
