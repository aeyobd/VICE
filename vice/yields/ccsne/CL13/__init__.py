================================================================== 
Importing this module will automatically set all yield settings 
from core collapse supernovae to the IMF-integrated yields as 
determined from the simulations ran by Chieffi & Limongi (2013) 
at solar metallicity. 

VICE achieves this by calling yields.ccsne.fractional for every 
element built into the software and storing the returned value in 
yields.ccsne.settings.  

set_params :: Update the parameters with which the yields are calculated 

Notes 
===== 
By importing this module, the user does not sacrifice the flexibility of 
VICE's user specified yields. After importing this module, the fields of 
vice.yields.ccsne.settings can still be modified in whatever manner the 
user sees fit. 

This module is not imported with the simple 'import vice' statement. 

Example 
======= 
>>> from vice.yields.ccsne import CL13 
>>> CL13.set_params(lower = 0.3, upper = 40, IMF = "salpeter")
