	Parameters
	========== 
	element :: str 
		The symbol of the element to calculate the IMF-integrated fractional 
		yield for. 
	study :: str [case-insensitive] [default :: "LC18"]
		A keyword denoting which study to adopt the yield from 
		Keywords and their Associated Studies
		-------------------------------------

		"WW95" :: Woosley & Weaver (1995) ApJ, 101, 181 
	MoverH :: real number [default :: 0] 
		The total metallicity [M/H] of the exploding stars. There are only a 
		handful of metallicities recognized by each study, and VICE will 
		raise a LookupError if this value is not one of them. 
		Keywords and their Associated Metallicities
		-------------------------------------------
		"LC18" :: [M/H] = -3, -2, -1, 0 
		"CL13" :: [M/H] = 0 
		"CL04" :: [M/H] = -inf, -4, -2, -1, -0.37, 0.15 
		"WW95" :: [M/H] = -inf, -4, -2, -1, 0
	rotation :: real number [default :: 0] 
		The rotational velocity of the exploding stars in km/s. There are only 
		a handful of rotational velocities recognized by each study, and 
		VICE will raise a LookupError if this value is not one of them. 
		Keywords and their Associated Rotational Velocities
		---------------------------------------------------
		"LC18" :: v = 0, 150, 300

		The stellar initial mass function (IMF) to adopt. This must be either 
		"kroupa" (1) or "salpeter" (2). 
	method :: str [case-insensitive] [default :: "simpson"] 
		The method of quadrature. The numerical rules implemented here are of 
		the forms outlined in chapter 4 of Numerical Recipes (Press, Teukolsky, 
		Vetterling & Flannery).

	m_upper :: real number [default :: 100] 
		The upper mass limit on star formation in solar masses. 
	tolerance :: real number [default :: 0.001] 
		The numerical tolerance. The subroutines implementing Gaussian 
		quadrature in VICE will not return a result until the fractional 
		change between two successive integrations is smaller than this value. 
	Nmin :: real number [default :: 64] 
		The minimum number of bins in quadrature. 
	Nmax :: real number [default :: 2e+08]

		The numerically determined solution. 
	error :: real number 
		The estimated fractional numerical error. 

	Raises
	======

		:: 	Nmin > Nmax 
	LookupError :: 
		:: 	The study did not report yields at the specified metallicity 
		:: 	The study did not report yields at the specified rotational
			velocity 
	ScienceWarning :: 
		:: 	m_upper is larger than the largest mass on the grid reported by the 
			specified study. VICE extrapolates to high masses in this case. 
		:: 	study is either "CL04" or "CL13" and the atomic number of the 
			element is between 24 and 28 (inclusive). VICE warns against 
			adopting these yields for iron peak elements. 
		:: 	Numerical quadrature did not converge within the maximum number 
			of allowed quadrature bins to within the specified tolerance. 

	Notes
	=====
	This function evaluates the solution to the following equation under the 
	assumption that all stars above 8 solar masses and below the upper mass 
	limit on star formation explode as a core-collapse supernova. 

	y_x^CC = \\frac{
		\\int_8^u M_x\\frac{dN}{dM}dM
	}{
		\\int_l^u M\\frac{dN}{dM}dM
	}

	where M_x is the mass of the element x produced in the super of a star 
	with initial mass M, and dN/dM is the stellar IMF. 

	Example
	=======
	>>> y, err = vice.fractional_cc_yield("o")
	>>> y
	    0.005643252355030168
	>>> err 
	    4.137197161389483e-06
	>>> y, err = vice.fractional_cc_yield("mg", study = "CL13") 
	>>> y 
	    0.000496663271667762

	Science Warnings 
	================
	1) The Limongi & Chieffi (2018) and Chieffi & Limongi (2013) studies 
	reported yields up to 120 Msun, so warn the user that for upper mass 
	limits higher than this that their yields will be extrapolated. The same 
	is true for the Chieffi & Limongi (2004) yields with upper mass limits 
	of 35 Msun. 

	2) The Chieffi & Limongi (2004) and the Chieffi & Limongi (2013) studies 
	involved numerical simulations of core collapse explosions with dialed-in 
	explosion energy. In their models, the mass of nickel-56 produced was 
	fixed. As such, one should exercise caution when employing their yields of 
	iron-peak elements.
